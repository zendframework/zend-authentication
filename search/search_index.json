Common credential\ntreatments include \nMD5()\n and \nPASSWORD()\n.\n\n\nConfiguration Options\n\n\nThe available configuration options include:\n\n\n\n\ntableName\n: This is the name of the database table that contains the\n  authentication credentials, and against which the database authentication\n  query is performed.\n\n\nidentityColumn\n: This is the name of the database table column used to\n  represent the identity.  The identity column must contain unique values, such\n  as a username or e-mail address.\n\n\ncredentialColumn\n: This is the name of the database table column used to\n  represent the credential. Under a simple identity and password authentication\n  scheme, the credential value corresponds to the password. See also the\n  \ncredentialTreatment\n option.\n\n\ncredentialTreatment\n: In many cases, passwords and other sensitive data\n  are encrypted, hashed, encoded, obscured, salted or otherwise treated through\n  some function or algorithm. By specifying a parameterized treatment string\n  with this method, such as '\nMD5(?)\n' or '\nPASSWORD(?)\n', a developer may\n  apply such arbitrary SQL upon input credential data. Since these functions\n  are specific to the underlying RDBMS, check the database manual for the\n  availability of such functions for your database system.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Usage\n\n\nAs explained above, the\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CredentialTreatmentAdapter\n constructor\nrequires an instance of \nZend\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter\n that serves as the database\nconnection to which the authentication adapter instance is bound. First, the\ndatabase connection should be created.\n\n\nThe following code creates an adapter for an in-memory database, creates a\nsimple table schema, and inserts a row against which we can perform an\nauthentication query later. This example requires the PDO SQLite extension to\nbe available:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter as DbAdapter;\n\n// Create a SQLite database connection\n$dbAdapter = new DbAdapter([\n    'driver'   => 'Pdo_Sqlite',\n    'database' => 'data/users.db',\n]);\n\n// Build a simple table creation query\n$sqlCreate = 'CREATE TABLE [users] ('\n    . '[id] INTEGER  NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, '\n    . '[username] VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, '\n    . '[password] VARCHAR(32) NULL, '\n    .

Depending on how you've decided to explain your\nproblem, it sometimes makes sense to solve what could look like an\nauthorization problem within the authentication adapter.\n\n\nBelow are a few examples showing how you can provide compound criteria to the\ncredential treatment to solve more complex problems.\n\n\nCheck for compromised user\n\n\nIn this scenario, we use the credential treatment \nMD5()\n, but also check to see\nthat the user has not been flagged as \"compromised\", which is a potential value\nof the \nstatus\n field for the user record.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CredentialTreatmentAdapter as AuthAdapter;\n\n// The status field value of an account is not equal to \"compromised\"\n$adapter = new AuthAdapter(\n    $db,\n    'users',\n    'username',\n    'password',\n    'MD5(?) AND status != \"compromised\"'\n);\n\n\n\nCheck for active user\n\n\nIn this example, we check to see if a user is active; this may be necessary\nif we require a user to login once over X days, or if we need to ensure that\nthey have followed a verification process.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CredentialTreatmentAdapter as AuthAdapter;\n\n// The active field value of an account is equal to \"TRUE\"\n$adapter = new AuthAdapter(\n    $db,\n    'users',\n    'username',\n    'password',\n    'MD5(?) AND active = \"TRUE\"'\n);\n\n\n\nSalting\n\n\nAnother scenario can be the implementation of a salting mechanism. Salting\nrefers to a technique for improving application security; it's based on the\nidea that concatenating a random string to every password makes it impossible\nto accomplish a successful brute force attack on the database using\npre-computed hash values from a dictionary.\n\n\nLet's modify our table to store our salt string:\n\n\n$sqlAlter = \"ALTER TABLE [users] \"\n    . \"ADD COLUMN [password_salt] \"\n    . \"AFTER [password]\";\n\n\n\nSalts should be created \nfor each user\n using a cryptographically sound pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). PHP 7 provides an implementation via \nrandom_bytes\n:\n\n\n$salt = random_bytes(32);\n\n\n\nFor earlier versions of PHP, use \nzend-math\n's \nZend\\Math\\Rand\n:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Math\\Rand;\n\n$salt = Rand::getBytes(32, true);\n\n\n\n(As of zend-math 2.7.0, \nRand::getBytes()\n will proxy to \nrandom_bytes()\n when\nrunning under PHP 7, making it a good, forwards-compatible solution for your\napplication.)\n\n\nDo this each time you create a user or update their password, and store it in the\n\npassword_salt\n column you created.\n\n\nNow let's build the adapter:\n\n\n$adapter = new AuthAdapter(\n$db,\n    'users',\n    'username',\n    'password',\n    \"MD5(CONCAT('staticSalt', ?, password_salt))\"\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nSalt security\n\n\nYou can improve security even more by using a static salt value hard coded\ninto your application. In the case that your database is compromised (e.g.\nby an SQL injection attack) but your web server is intact, your data is still\nunusable for the attacker.\n\n\nDefine the salt as an environment variable on your web server, and then\neither pull it from the environment, or assign it to a constant during\nbootstrap; pass the value to the credential treatment when creating your\nadapter.\n\n\nThe above example uses the value \"staticSalt\"; you should create a better\nsalt using one of the methods outlined above.\n\n\n\n\nAlter the SQL select directly\n\n\nAnother alternative is to use the \ngetDbSelect()\n method to retrieve the\n\nZend\\Db\\Sql\\Select\n instance associated with the adapter and modify it. (The\nmethod is common to all \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\n adapters.) The\n\nSelect\n instance is consumed by the \nauthenticate()\n routine when building the\nSQL to execute on the RDBMS server.  It is important to note that this method\nwill always return the same \nSelect\n instance regardless if \nauthenticate()\n\nhas been called or not; identity and credential values are passed to the\ninstance as placeholders.\n\n\nThis approach allows you to define a generic credential treatment, and then add\ncriteria later, potentially based on specific paths through the application.\n\n\nThe following uses the second example in this section, adding another \nWHERE\n\nclause to determine if the user is active in the system.\n\n\n// Create a basic adapter, with only an MD5() credential treatment:\n$adapter = new AuthAdapter(\n    $db,\n    'users',\n    'username',\n    'password',\n    'MD5(?)'\n);\n\n// Now retrieve the Select instance and modify it:\n$select = $adapter->getDbSelect();\n$select->where('active = \"TRUE\"');\n\n// Authenticate; this will include \"users.active = TRUE\" in the WHERE clause:\n$adapter->authenticate();",

Other\ntimes, you may be unsure which RDBMS system you will be using long-term, and\nneed to ensure authentication will work consistently. For these situations, you\ncan use the \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CallbackCheckAdapter\n adapter.\nSimilar to the \nCredentialTreatmentAdapter\n, it\naccepts a table name, identity column, and credential column; however, instead\nof a credential treatment, it accepts a \ncredential validation callback\n that\nis executed when the database returns any matches, and which can be used to\nperform additional credential verifications.\n\n\nConfiguration options\n\n\nThe available configuration options include:\n\n\n\n\ntableName\n: This is the name of the database table that contains the\n  authentication credentials, and against which the database authentication\n  query is performed.\n\n\nidentityColumn\n: This is the name of the database table column used to\n  represent the identity.

Additionally, you may want to ensure that should you\nswitch database systems, hashing is consistent. This is a perfect use case for\nthe \nCallbackCheckAdapter\n adapter; you can implement the password hashing and\nverification within PHP instead.\n\n\nThe following code creates an adapter for an in-memory database, creates a\nsimple table schema, and inserts a row against which we can perform an\nauthentication query later. This example requires the PDO SQLite extension to\nbe available:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter as DbAdapter;\n\n// Create a SQLite database connection\n$dbAdapter = new DbAdapter([\n    'driver'   => 'Pdo_Sqlite',\n    'database' => 'data/sqlite.db',\n]);\n\n// Build a simple table creation query\n$sqlCreate = 'CREATE TABLE [users] ('\n    .

For users on PHP 5.5+, you can use\n\npassword_hash()\n:\n\n\n$hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n\n\n\n\n\nPassword hash length\n\n\nAs of the time of writing, PHP uses a bcrypt algorithm by default for hashing\npasswords with \npassword_hash()\n, and this produces 60 character strings. However,\nthe default may change over time, and php.net recommends using 255 character\nfields for storage to allow for larger hash sizes in the future.\n\n\n\n\nTo verify a password, we'll create a callback that uses\n\npassword_verify()\n:\n\n\n$passwordValidation = function ($hash, $password) {\n    return password_verify($password, $hash);\n};\n\n\n\nNow that we have the database connection and a password validation function,\nwe can create our \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CallbackCheckAdapter\n adapter\ninstance, passing the options to the constructor or later via setter methods:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CallbackCheckAdapter as AuthAdapter;\n\n// Configure the instance with constructor parameters:\n$authAdapter = new AuthAdapter(\n    $dbAdapter,\n    'users',\n    'username',\n    'password',\n    $passwordValidation\n);\n\n// Or configure the instance with setter methods:\n$authAdapter = new AuthAdapter($dbAdapter);\n\n$authAdapter\n    ->setTableName('users')\n    ->setIdentityColumn('username')\n    ->setCredentialColumn('password')\n    ->setCredentialValidatinCallback($passwordValidation);\n\n\n\nAt this point, the authentication adapter instance is ready to accept\nauthentication queries. In order to formulate an authentication query, the\ninput credential values are passed to the adapter prior to calling the\n\nauthenticate()\n method:\n\n\n// Set the input credential values (e.g., from a login form):\n$authAdapter\n    ->setIdentity('my_username')\n    ->setCredential('my_password');\n\n// Perform the authentication query, saving the result\n$result = $authAdapter->authenticate();\n\n\n\nIn addition to the availability of the \ngetIdentity()\n method upon the\nauthentication result object, \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CallbackCheckAdapter\n\nalso supports retrieving the table row upon authentication success:\n\n\n// Print the identity:\necho $result->getIdentity() . \"\\n\\n\";\n\n// Print the result row:\nprint_r($authAdapter->getResultRowObject());\n\n/* Output:\nmy_username\n\nArray\n(\n    [id] => 1\n    [username] => my_username\n    [password] => my_password\n    [real_name] => My Real Name\n)\n*/\n\n\n\nSince the table row contains the credential value, it is important to secure\nthe values against unintended access.\n\n\nWhen retrieving the result object, we can either specify what columns to\nreturn, or what columns to omit:\n\n\n// Specify the columns to return:\n$columnsToReturn = [\n    'id',\n    'username',\n    'real_name',\n];\nprint_r($authAdapter->getResultRowObject($columnsToReturn));\n\n/* Output:\n\nArray\n(\n   [id] => 1\n   [username] => my_username\n   [real_name] => My Real Name\n)\n*/\n\n// Or specify the columns to omit; when using this approach,\n// pass a null value as the first argument to getResultRowObject():\n$columnsToOmit = ['password'];\nprint_r($authAdapter->getResultRowObject(null, $columnsToOmit);\n\n/* Output:\n\nArray\n(\n   [id] => 1\n   [username] => my_username\n   [real_name] => My Real Name\n)\n*/\n\n\n\nAdvanced Usage\n\n\nWhile the basic use case will fit most scenarios, there may be cases where you have\nspecialized needs, such as additional criteria that needs to be met for a user to\nmatch.\n\n\nAdding criteria to match\n\n\nSince the validation callback is only provided the hash value from the database\nand the credential provided by the user, you cannot do more complex matching\nwithin it. However, you can add criteria to the SQL sent to the server by\nretrieving the \nZend\\Db\\Sql\\Select\n instance is uses.\n\n\nAs an example, many websites require a user to activate their account before\nallowing them to login for the first time. We can add that criteria as follows:\n\n\n// Create a basic adapter, with only an MD5() credential treatment:\n$adapter = new AuthAdapter(\n    $db,\n    'users',\n    'username',\n    'password',\n    $passwordValidation\n);\n\n// Now retrieve the Select instance and modify it:\n$select = $adapter->getDbSelect();\n$select->where('active = \"TRUE\"');\n\n// Authenticate; this will include \"users.active = TRUE\" in the WHERE clause:\n$adapter->authenticate();",

The following code creates an adapter for an in-memory database, creates a\nsimple table schema, and inserts a row against which we can perform an\nauthentication query later. This example requires the PDO SQLite extension to\nbe available:  use Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter as DbAdapter;\n\n// Create a SQLite database connection\n$dbAdapter = new DbAdapter([\n    'driver'   => 'Pdo_Sqlite',\n    'database' => 'data/sqlite.db',\n]);\n\n// Build a simple table creation query\n$sqlCreate = 'CREATE TABLE [users] ('\n    .

However,\nthe default may change over time, and php.net recommends using 255 character\nfields for storage to allow for larger hash sizes in the future.   To verify a password, we'll create a callback that uses password_verify() :  $passwordValidation = function ($hash, $password) {\n    return password_verify($password, $hash);\n};  Now that we have the database connection and a password validation function,\nwe can create our  Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CallbackCheckAdapter  adapter\ninstance, passing the options to the constructor or later via setter methods:  use Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CallbackCheckAdapter as AuthAdapter;\n\n// Configure the instance with constructor parameters:\n$authAdapter = new AuthAdapter(\n    $dbAdapter,\n    'users',\n    'username',\n    'password',\n    $passwordValidation\n);\n\n// Or configure the instance with setter methods:\n$authAdapter = new AuthAdapter($dbAdapter);\n\n$authAdapter\n    ->setTableName('users')\n    ->setIdentityColumn('username')\n    ->setCredentialColumn('password')\n    ->setCredentialValidatinCallback($passwordValidation);  At this point, the authentication adapter instance is ready to accept\nauthentication queries. In order to formulate an authentication query, the\ninput credential values are passed to the adapter prior to calling the authenticate()  method:  // Set the input credential values (e.g., from a login form):\n$authAdapter\n    ->setIdentity('my_username')\n    ->setCredential('my_password');\n\n// Perform the authentication query, saving the result\n$result = $authAdapter->authenticate();  In addition to the availability of the  getIdentity()  method upon the\nauthentication result object,  Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\DbTable\\CallbackCheckAdapter \nalso supports retrieving the table row upon authentication success:  // Print the identity:\necho $result->getIdentity() . \"\\n\\n\";\n\n// Print the result row:\nprint_r($authAdapter->getResultRowObject());\n\n/* Output:\nmy_username\n\nArray\n(\n    [id] => 1\n    [username] => my_username\n    [password] => my_password\n    [real_name] => My Real Name\n)\n*/  Since the table row contains the credential value, it is important to secure\nthe values against unintended access.  When retrieving the result object, we can either specify what columns to\nreturn, or what columns to omit:  // Specify the columns to return:\n$columnsToReturn = [\n    'id',\n    'username',\n    'real_name',\n];\nprint_r($authAdapter->getResultRowObject($columnsToReturn));\n\n/* Output:\n\nArray\n(\n   [id] => 1\n   [username] => my_username\n   [real_name] => My Real Name\n)\n*/\n\n// Or specify the columns to omit; when using this approach,\n// pass a null value as the first argument to getResultRowObject():\n$columnsToOmit = ['password'];\nprint_r($authAdapter->getResultRowObject(null, $columnsToOmit);\n\n/* Output:\n\nArray\n(\n   [id] => 1\n   [username] => my_username\n   [real_name] => My Real Name\n)\n*/",

This setting is supposed to determine the valid lifetime of a given\nnonce, or effectively how long a client's authentication information is\naccepted. As an example, if it's set to 3600, it will cause the adapter to\nprompt the client for new credentials every hour, on the hour.  This will be\nresolved in a future release, once nonce tracking and stale support are\nimplemented.\n\n\n\n\nResolvers\n\n\nA resolver's job is to take a username and realm, and return some kind of\ncredential value. Basic authentication expects to receive the base64-encoded\nversion of the user's password. Digest authentication expects to receive a hash\nof the user's username, the realm, and their password (each separated by\ncolons). Currently, the only supported hash algorithm is MD5.\n\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Http\n relies on objects implementing\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Http\\ResolverInterface\n. The component includes\nresolvers for plain text files and Apache \nhtpasswd\n-generated files; you can\nalso provide your own implementations.\n\n\nFile Resolver\n\n\nThe file resolver is a very simple class. It has a single property specifying a\nfilename, which can also be passed to the constructor. Its \nresolve()\n method\nwalks through the text file, searching for a line with a matching username and\nrealm. The text file format is similar to Apache \nhtpasswd\n files:\n\n\n<username>:<realm>:<credentials>\n\n\n\nEach line consists of three fields \u2014 username, realm, and credentials\n\u2014 each separated by a colon.  The credentials field is opaque to the file\nresolver; it simply returns that value as-is to the caller. Therefore, this\nsame file format serves both Basic and Digest authentication. In Basic\nauthentication, the credentials field should be written in clear text. In\nDigest authentication, it should be the MD5 hash described above.\n\n\nThere are two ways to create a file resolver:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Http\\FileResolver;\n\n$path     = 'data/passwd.txt';\n$resolver = new FileResolver($path);\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n$path     = 'data/passwd.txt';\n$resolver = new FileResolver();\n$resolver->setFile($path);\n\n\n\nIf the given path is empty or not readable, an exception is thrown.\n\n\nApache Resolver\n\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Http\\ApacheResolver\n operates similarly to the\n\nFileResolver\n, but is capable of reading files generated by Apache's \nhtpasswd\n\nfacility, as described in the \nApache documentation\n.\n\n\nIn order to do so, you will need to also install \nzend-crypt\n:\n\n\n$ composer require zendframework/zend-crypt\n\n\n\nIn all other ways, it behaves like the \nFileResolver\n, meaning you instantiate\nit with a path to the \nhtpasswd\n-generated file, or inject the path after\ninstantiation:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Http\\ApacheResolver;\n\n$path = 'data/htpasswd';\n\n// Inject at instantiation:\n$resolver = new ApacheResolver($path);\n\n// Or afterwards:\n$resolver = new ApacheResolver();\n$resolver->setFile($path);\n\n\n\nBasic Usage\n\n\nFirst, set up an array with the required configuration values:\n\n\n$config = [\n    'accept_schemes' => 'basic digest',\n    'realm'          => 'My Web Site',\n    'digest_domains' => '/members_only /my_account',\n    'nonce_timeout'  => 3600,\n];\n\n\n\nThis array will cause the adapter to accept either Basic or Digest\nauthentication, and will require authenticated access to all the areas of the\nsite under \n/members_only\n and \n/my_account\n. The realm value is usually\ndisplayed by the browser in the password dialog box. The \nnonce_timeout\n\nbehaves as described above.\n\n\nNext, create the \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Http\n object:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Http;\n\n$adapter = new Http($config);\n\n\n\nSince we're supporting both Basic and Digest authentication, we need two\ndifferent resolver objects.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Http\\FileResolver;\n\n$basicResolver  = new FileResolver('data/basic-passwd.txt');\n$digestResolver = new FileResolver('data/digest-passwd.txt');\n\n$adapter->setBasicResolver($basicResolver);\n$adapter->setDigestResolver($digestResolver);\n\n\n\nFinally, we perform authentication. The adapter requires zend-http request and\nresponse instances in order to lookup credentials and provide challenge responses:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Http\\Request;\nuse Zend\\Http\\Response;\n\n// $request is an instance of Request\n// $response is an instance of Response\n$adapter->setRequest($request);\n$adapter->setResponse($response);\n\n$result = $adapter->authenticate();\nif (! $result->isValid()) {\n    // Bad username/password, or canceled password prompt\n}",

            "text": "LDAP Authentication\n\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n supports web application authentication with\nLDAP services. Its features include username and domain name canonicalization,\nmulti-domain authentication, and failover capabilities. It has been tested to\nwork with \nMicrosoft Active Directory\n\nand \nOpenLDAP\n, but it should also work with other\nLDAP service providers.\n\n\nThis documentation includes a guide on using \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n,\nan exploration of its API, an outline of the various available options,\ndiagnostic information for troubleshooting authentication problems, and example\noptions for both Active Directory and OpenLDAP servers.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates creating and configuring the \nLdap\n\nauthentication adapter, and also illustrates how to work with the\nauthentication messages returned in the authentication result.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService;\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap as LdapAdapter;\n\n// Retrieve the username and pasword from the request somehow.\n$username = /* ... */;\n$password = /* ... */;\n\n$auth = new AuthenticationService();\n\n$config = [\n    'server1' => [\n        'host'                   => 's0.foo.net',\n        'accountDomainName'      => 'foo.net',\n        'accountDomainNameShort' => 'FOO',\n        'accountCanonicalForm'   => 3,\n        'username'               => 'CN=user1,DC=foo,DC=net',\n        'password'               => 'pass1',\n        'baseDn'                 => 'OU=Sales,DC=foo,DC=net',\n        'bindRequiresDn'         => true,\n    ],\n    'server2' => [\n        'host'                   => 'dc1.w.net',\n        'useStartTls'            => true,\n        'accountDomainName'      => 'w.net',\n        'accountDomainNameShort' => 'W',\n        'accountCanonicalForm'   => 3,\n        'baseDn'                 => 'CN=Users,DC=w,DC=net',\n    ],\n];\n\n$adapter = new LdapAdapter($config, $username, $password);\n\n$result = $auth->authenticate($adapter);\n\n// Messages from position 2 and up are informational messages from the LDAP\n// server:\nforeach ($result->getMessages() as $i => $message) {\n    if ($i < 2) {\n        continue;\n    }\n\n    // Potentially log the $message\n}\n\n\n\nAs noted in the above example, the returned authentication result contains\nmessages even on success.  LDAP has some notoriety for difficulty in debugging,\nand the \nLdap\n adapter attempts to assist you with this by providing\ninformational messages for every authentication attempt. A later section in\nthis document provides more detail on the messages returned.\n\n\nYou will note that the configuration contains information for multiple servers.\nWhen multiple server configuration is provided, the adapter will loop through\neach until one provides successful authentication.  The above configuration\nwill instruct the adapter to attempt authenticattion against the OpenLDAP\nserver \ns0.foo.net\n first, falling back to the Active Directory server\n\ndc1.w.net\non failure.\n\n\nWith servers in different domains, this configuration illustrates multi-domain\nauthentication. You can also have multiple servers in the same domain to\nprovide redundancy.\n\n\nNote that in this case, even though OpenLDAP has no need for the short NetBIOS\nstyle domain name used by Windows, we provide it here for name canonicalization\npurposes (described in the \nUsername Canonicalization\n\nsection below).\n\n\nA later section on \nserver options\n details all available options)\n\n\nThe API\n\n\nThe \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n constructor accepts three parameters.\n\n\nThe \n$options\n parameter is required and must be an array containing one or\nmore sets of options.  Note that it is \nan array of arrays\n, with each\nsub-array providing \nzend-ldap\n\noptions. Even if you will be using only one LDAP server, the options must still\nbe within a sub-array.\n\n\nReferring back to the example in the previous section, the information provided\nin each set of options is different mainly because Active Directory does not\nrequire a username be in DN form when binding (see the \nbindRequiresDn\n option\nin the \nServer Options\n section below), which means we can\nomit a number of options associated with retrieving the DN for a username being\nauthenticated.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Distinguished Name?\n\n\nA DN or \"distinguished name\" is a string that represents the path to an\nobject within the LDAP directory. Each comma-separated component is an\nattribute and value representing a node. The components are evaluated in\nreverse. For example, the user account \nCN=Bob Carter,CN=Users,DC=w,DC=net\n\nis located directly within the \nCN=Users,DC=w,DC=net container\n.  This\nstructure is best explored with an LDAP browser like the ADSI Edit MMC\nsnap-in for Active Directory or phpLDAPadmin.\n\n\n\n\nThe names of servers (e.g. 'server1' and 'server2' shown above) are largely\narbitrary and only used for informational purposes by the adapter. We recommend\nusing string identifiers that omit any HTML/XML entity references to ensure\nthey do not break any logging displays.\n\n\nWith multiple sets of server options, the adapter can authenticate users in\nmultiple domains and provide failover so that if one server is not available,\nanother will be queried.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gory Details: What Happens in the Authenticate Method?\n\n\nWhen the \nauthenticate()\n method is called, the adapter iterates over each\nset of server options, passes them to the internal \nZend\\Ldap\\Ldap\n instance,\nand calls the \nZend\\Ldap\\Ldap::bind()\n method with the username and password\nbeing authenticated.\n\n\nZend\\Ldap\\Ldap\n checks to see if the username is qualified with a domain\n(e.g., has a domain component like \nalice@foo.net\n or \nFOO\\alice\n). If a\ndomain is present, but does not match either of the server's domain names\n(e.g., \nfoo.net\n or \nFOO\n), a special exception is thrown and caught by\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n that causes that server to be ignored, and\nprogression to the next server configured.\n\n\nIf a domain matches, or if the user did not supply a qualified username,\n\nZend\\Ldap\\Ldap\n proceeds to try to bind with the supplied credentials. if\nthe bind is unsuccessful, \nZend\\Ldap\\Ldap\n throws a\n\nZend\\Ldap\\Exception\\LdapException\n which is caught by\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n and, again, the adapter progresses to the\nnext configured server.\n\n\nIf the bind is successful, server iteration stops, and the adapter's\n\nauthenticate()\n method returns a successful result.\n\n\nIf all configured servers fail to authenticate, \nauthenticate()\n returns a\nfailure result with error messages from the last server consulted.\n\n\n\n\nThe username and password parameters of the \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n\nconstructor represent the credentials being authenticated (i.e., the\ncredentials supplied by the user through your HTML login form). Alternatively,\nthey may also be set with the \nsetUsername()\n and \nsetPassword()\n methods.\n\n\nServer Options\n\n\nEach set of server options in the context of \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n\nconsists of the following options, which are passed, largely unmodified, to\n\nZend\\Ldap\\Ldap::setOptions()\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhost\n\n\nThe hostname of LDAP server that these options represent. This option is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nport\n\n\nThe port on which the LDAP server is listening. If \nuseSsl\n is \nTRUE\n, the default port value is 636. If \nuseSsl\n is \nFALSE\n, the default port value is 389.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseStartTls\n\n\nWhether or not the LDAP client should use TLS (aka SSLv2) encrypted transport. A value of \nTRUE\n is strongly favored in production environments to prevent passwords from be transmitted in clear text. The default value is \nFALSE\n, as servers frequently require that a certificate be installed separately after installation. The \nuseSsl\n and \nuseStartTls\n options are mutually exclusive. The \nuseStartTls\n option should be favored over \nuseSsl\n, but not all servers support this newer mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseSsl\n\n\nWhether or not the LDAP client should use SSL encrypted transport. The \nuseSsl\n and \nuseStartTls\n options are mutually exclusive, but \nuseStartTls\n should be favored if the server and LDAP client library support it. This value also changes the default port value (see port description above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nThe DN of the account used to perform account DN lookups. LDAP servers that require the username to be in DN form when performing the \u201cbind\u201d require this option. Meaning, if \nbindRequiresDn\n is \nTRUE\n, this option is required. This account does not need to be a privileged account; an account with read-only access to objects under the \nbaseDn\n is all that is necessary (and preferred based on the Principle of Least Privilege).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassword\n\n\nThe password of the account used to perform account DN lookups. If this option is not supplied, the LDAP client will attempt an \u201canonymous bind\u201d when performing account DN lookups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbindRequiresDn\n\n\nSome LDAP servers require that the username used to bind be in DN form like \nCN=Alice Baker,OU=Sales,DC=foo,DC=net\n (basically all servers except Active Directory). If this option is \nTRUE\n, this instructs \nZend\\Ldap\\Ldap\n to automatically retrieve the DN corresponding to the username being authenticated, if it is not already in DN form, and then re-bind with the proper DN. The default value is \nFALSE\n. Currently only Microsoft Active Directory Server (ADS) is known not to require usernames to be in DN form when binding, and therefore this option may be \nFALSE\n with AD (and it should be, as retrieving the DN requires an extra round trip to the server). Otherwise, this option must be set to \nTRUE\n (e.g. for OpenLDAP). This option also controls the default \naccountFilterFormat\n used when searching for accounts. See the \naccountFilterFormat\n option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbaseDn\n\n\nThe DN under which all accounts being authenticated are located. This option is required. if you are uncertain about the correct baseDn value, it should be sufficient to derive it from the user\u2019s DNS domain using \nDC=\n components. For example, if the user\u2019s principal name is \nalice@foo.net\n, a \nbaseDn\n of \nDC=foo,DC=net\n should work. A more precise location (e.g., \nOU=Sales,DC=foo,DC=net\n) will be more efficient, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountCanonicalForm\n\n\nA value of 2, 3, or 4 indicating the form to which account names should be canonicalized after successful authentication. Values are as follows: 2 for traditional username style names (e.g., \nalice\n), 3 for backslash-style names (e.g., \nFOO\\alice\n) or 4 for principal style usernames (e.g., \nalice@foo.net\n). The default value is 4 (e.g., \nalice@foo.net\n). For example, with a value of 3, the identity returned by \nZend\\Authentication\\Result::getIdentity()\n (and \nZend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService::getIdentity()\n, if \nZend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService\n was used) will always be \nFOO\\alice\n, regardless of what form Alice supplied, whether it be \nalice\n, \nalice@foo.net\n, \nFOO\\alice\n, \nFoO\\aLicE\n, \nfoo.net\\alice\n, etc. See the []Account Name Canonicalization](http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/modules/zend.ldap.introduction.html#account-name-canonicalization) section in the zend-ldap documentation for details. Note that when using multiple sets of server options it is recommended, but not required, that the same \naccountCanonicalForm\n be used with all server options so that the resulting usernames are always canonicalized to the same form (e.g., if you canonicalize to \nEXAMPLE\\username\n with an AD server but to \nusername@example.com\n with an OpenLDAP server, that may be awkward for the application\u2019s high-level logic).\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountDomainName\n\n\nThe FQDN domain name for which the target LDAP server is an authority (e.g., \nexample.com\n). This option is used to canonicalize names so that the username supplied by the user can be converted as necessary for binding. It is also used to determine if the server is an authority for the supplied username (e.g., if \naccountDomainName\n is \nfoo.net\n and the user supplies \nbob@bar.net\n, the server will not be queried, and a failure will result). This option is not required, but if it is not supplied, usernames in principal name form (e.g., \nalice@foo.net\n) are not supported. It is strongly recommended that you supply this option, as there are many use-cases that require generating the principal name form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountDomainNameShort\n\n\nThe \u2018short\u2019 domain for which the target LDAP server is an authority (e.g., \nFOO\n). Note that there is a 1:1 mapping between the \naccountDomainName\n and \naccountDomainNameShort\n. This option should be used to specify the NetBIOS domain name for Windows networks, but may also be used by non-AD servers (e.g., for consistency when multiple sets of server options with the backslash style \naccountCanonicalForm\n). This option is not required but if it is not supplied, usernames in backslash form (e.g., \nFOO\\alice\n) are not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountFilterFormat\n\n\nThe LDAP search filter used to search for accounts. This string is a \nprintf()\n-style expression that must contain one \n%s\n to accommodate the username. The default value is \n(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=%s))\n, unless \nbindRequiresDn\n is set to \nTRUE\n, in which case the default is \n(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=%s))\n. For example, if for some reason you wanted to use \nbindRequiresDn = true\n with AD you would need to set \naccountFilterFormat = '(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=%s))'\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noptReferrals\n\n\nIf set to \nTRUE\n, this option indicates to the LDAP client that referrals should be followed. The default value is \nFALSE\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLS and SSL\n\n\nIf you enable \nuseStartTls = TRUE\n or \nuseSsl = TRUE\n you may find that the\nLDAP client generates an error claiming that it cannot validate the server's\ncertificate. Assuming the PHP LDAP extension is ultimately linked to the\nOpenLDAP client libraries, to resolve this issue you can set \nTLS_REQCERT\nnever\n in the OpenLDAP client \nldap.conf\n (and restart the web server) to\nindicate to the OpenLDAP client library that you trust the server.\nAlternately, if you are concerned that the server could be spoofed, you can\nexport the LDAP server's root certificate and put it on the web server so\nthat the OpenLDAP client can validate the server's identity.\n\n\n\n\nCollecting Debugging Messages\n\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n collects debugging information within its\n\nauthenticate()\n method. This information is stored in the\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Result\n object as messages. The array returned by\n\nZend\\Authentication\\Result::getMessages()\n is described as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages Array Index\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex 0\n\n\nA generic, user-friendly message that is suitable for displaying to users (e.g., \"Invalid credentials\"). If the authentication is successful, this string is empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex 1\n\n\nA more detailed error message that is not suitable to be displayed to users but should be logged for the benefit of server operators. If the authentication is successful, this string is empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexes 2 and higher\n\n\nAll log messages in order starting at index 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, index 0 should be displayed to the user (e.g., using the\n\nFlashMessenger helper\n),\nindex 1 should be logged and, if debugging information is being collected,\nindexes 2 and higher could be logged as well (although the final message always\nincludes the string from index 1).\n\n\nCommon Options for Specific Servers\n\n\nOptions for Active Directory\n\n\nFor AD*, the following options are noteworthy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhost\n\n\nAs with all servers, this option is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseStartTls\n\n\nFor the sake of security, this should be \nTRUE\n if the server has the necessary certificate installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseSsl\n\n\nPossibly used as an alternative to \nuseStartTls\n (see above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbaseDn\n\n\nAs with all servers, this option is required. By default, AD places all user accounts under the Users container (e.g., \nCN=Users,DC=foo,DC=net\n), but the default is not common in larger organizations. Ask your AD administrator what the best DN for accounts for your application would be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountCanonicalForm\n\n\nYou almost certainly want this to be 3 for backslash style names (e.g., \nFOO\\alice\n), which are most familiar to Windows users. You should not use the unqualified form 2 (e.g., \nalice\n), as this may grant access to your application to users with the same username in other trusted domains (e.g., \nBAR\\alice\n and \nFOO\\alice\n will be treated as the same user). (See also note below.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountDomainName\n\n\nThis is required with AD unless \naccountCanonicalForm\n 2 is used, which, again, is discouraged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountDomainNameShort\n\n\nThe NetBIOS name of the domain that users are in and for which the AD server is an authority. This is required if the backslash style \naccountCanonicalForm\n is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse qualified account names\n\n\nTechnically there should be no danger of accidental cross-domain\nauthentication with the current \nZend\\Authentication\\Adapter\\Ldap\n\nimplementation, since server domains are explicitly checked, but this may not\nbe true of a future implementation that discovers the domain at runtime, or\nif an alternative adapter is used (e.g., Kerberos). In general, account name\nambiguity is known to be the source of security issues, so always try to use\nqualified account names.\n\n\n\n\nOptions for OpenLDAP\n\n\nFor OpenLDAP or a generic LDAP server using a typical posixAccount style\nschema, the following options are noteworthy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhost\n\n\nAs with all servers, this option is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseStartTls\n\n\nFor the sake of security, this should be \nTRUE\n if the server has the necessary certificate installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseSsl\n\n\nPossibly used as an alternative to \nuseStartTls\n (see above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusername\n\n\nRequired and must be a DN, as OpenLDAP requires that usernames be in DN form when performing a bind. Try to use an unprivileged account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassword\n\n\nThe password corresponding to the username above, but this may be omitted if the LDAP server permits an anonymous binding to query user accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbindRequiresDn\n\n\nRequired and must be TRUE, as OpenLDAP requires that usernames be in DN form when performing a bind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbaseDn\n\n\nAs with all servers, this option is required and indicates the DN under which all accounts being authenticated are located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountCanonicalForm\n\n\nOptional, but the default value is 4 (principal style names like \nalice@foo.net\n), which may not be ideal if your users are used to backslash style names (e.g., \nFOO\\alice\n). For backslash style names, use value 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountDomainName\n\n\nRequired unless you're using \naccountCanonicalForm\n 2, which is not recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccountDomainNameShort\n\n\nIf AD is not also being used, this value is not required. Otherwise, if \naccountCanonicalForm\n 3 is used, this option is required and should be a short name that corresponds adequately to the \naccountDomainName\n (e.g., if your \naccountDomainName\n is \nfoo.net\n, a good \naccountDomainNameShort\n value might be \nFOO\n).",

Zend\\Ldap\\Ldap  checks to see if the username is qualified with a domain\n(e.g., has a domain component like  alice@foo.net  or  FOO\\alice ).

This option is required.    port  The port on which the LDAP server is listening. If  useSsl  is  TRUE , the default port value is 636. If  useSsl  is  FALSE , the default port value is 389.    useStartTls  Whether or not the LDAP client should use TLS (aka SSLv2) encrypted transport. A value of  TRUE  is strongly favored in production environments to prevent passwords from be transmitted in clear text. The default value is  FALSE , as servers frequently require that a certificate be installed separately after installation. The  useSsl  and  useStartTls  options are mutually exclusive. The  useStartTls  option should be favored over  useSsl , but not all servers support this newer mechanism.    useSsl  Whether or not the LDAP client should use SSL encrypted transport. The  useSsl  and  useStartTls  options are mutually exclusive, but  useStartTls  should be favored if the server and LDAP client library support it. This value also changes the default port value (see port description above).    username  The DN of the account used to perform account DN lookups. LDAP servers that require the username to be in DN form when performing the \u201cbind\u201d require this option. Meaning, if  bindRequiresDn  is  TRUE , this option is required. This account does not need to be a privileged account; an account with read-only access to objects under the  baseDn  is all that is necessary (and preferred based on the Principle of Least Privilege).    password  The password of the account used to perform account DN lookups. If this option is not supplied, the LDAP client will attempt an \u201canonymous bind\u201d when performing account DN lookups.    bindRequiresDn  Some LDAP servers require that the username used to bind be in DN form like  CN=Alice Baker,OU=Sales,DC=foo,DC=net  (basically all servers except Active Directory). If this option is  TRUE , this instructs  Zend\\Ldap\\Ldap  to automatically retrieve the DN corresponding to the username being authenticated, if it is not already in DN form, and then re-bind with the proper DN. The default value is  FALSE . Currently only Microsoft Active Directory Server (ADS) is known not to require usernames to be in DN form when binding, and therefore this option may be  FALSE  with AD (and it should be, as retrieving the DN requires an extra round trip to the server). Otherwise, this option must be set to  TRUE  (e.g. for OpenLDAP). This option also controls the default  accountFilterFormat  used when searching for accounts. See the  accountFilterFormat  option.    baseDn  The DN under which all accounts being authenticated are located. This option is required. if you are uncertain about the correct baseDn value, it should be sufficient to derive it from the user\u2019s DNS domain using  DC=  components. For example, if the user\u2019s principal name is  alice@foo.net , a  baseDn  of  DC=foo,DC=net  should work. A more precise location (e.g.,  OU=Sales,DC=foo,DC=net ) will be more efficient, however.    accountCanonicalForm  A value of 2, 3, or 4 indicating the form to which account names should be canonicalized after successful authentication. Values are as follows: 2 for traditional username style names (e.g.,  alice ), 3 for backslash-style names (e.g.,  FOO\\alice ) or 4 for principal style usernames (e.g.,  alice@foo.net ). The default value is 4 (e.g.,  alice@foo.net ). For example, with a value of 3, the identity returned by  Zend\\Authentication\\Result::getIdentity()  (and  Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService::getIdentity() , if  Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService  was used) will always be  FOO\\alice , regardless of what form Alice supplied, whether it be  alice ,  alice@foo.net ,  FOO\\alice ,  FoO\\aLicE ,  foo.net\\alice , etc. See the []Account Name Canonicalization](http://framework.zend.com/manual/current/en/modules/zend.ldap.introduction.html#account-name-canonicalization) section in the zend-ldap documentation for details. Note that when using multiple sets of server options it is recommended, but not required, that the same  accountCanonicalForm  be used with all server options so that the resulting usernames are always canonicalized to the same form (e.g., if you canonicalize to  EXAMPLE\\username  with an AD server but to  username@example.com  with an OpenLDAP server, that may be awkward for the application\u2019s high-level logic).    accountDomainName  The FQDN domain name for which the target LDAP server is an authority (e.g.,  example.com ). This option is used to canonicalize names so that the username supplied by the user can be converted as necessary for binding. It is also used to determine if the server is an authority for the supplied username (e.g., if  accountDomainName  is  foo.net  and the user supplies  bob@bar.net , the server will not be queried, and a failure will result). This option is not required, but if it is not supplied, usernames in principal name form (e.g.,  alice@foo.net ) are not supported. It is strongly recommended that you supply this option, as there are many use-cases that require generating the principal name form.    accountDomainNameShort  The \u2018short\u2019 domain for which the target LDAP server is an authority (e.g.,  FOO ). Note that there is a 1:1 mapping between the  accountDomainName  and  accountDomainNameShort . This option should be used to specify the NetBIOS domain name for Windows networks, but may also be used by non-AD servers (e.g., for consistency when multiple sets of server options with the backslash style  accountCanonicalForm ). This option is not required but if it is not supplied, usernames in backslash form (e.g.,  FOO\\alice ) are not supported.    accountFilterFormat  The LDAP search filter used to search for accounts. This string is a  printf() -style expression that must contain one  %s  to accommodate the username. The default value is  (&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=%s)) , unless  bindRequiresDn  is set to  TRUE , in which case the default is  (&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=%s)) . For example, if for some reason you wanted to use  bindRequiresDn = true  with AD you would need to set  accountFilterFormat = '(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=%s))' .    optReferrals  If set to  TRUE , this option indicates to the LDAP client that referrals should be followed. The default value is  FALSE .",

First, implement  Zend\\Authentication\\Storage\\StorageInterface :  <?php\nnamespace My;\n\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\Storage\\StorageInterface;\n\nclass Storage implements StorageInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Returns true if and only if storage is empty.\n     *\n     * @return boolean\n     * @throws \\Zend\\Authentication\\Exception\\ExceptionInterface If it is\n     *     impossible to determine whether storage is empty.\n     */\n    public function isEmpty()\n    {\n        /**\n         * @todo implementation\n         */\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Returns the contents of storage.\n     *\n     * Behavior is undefined when storage is empty.\n     *\n     * @return mixed\n     * @throws \\Zend\\Authentication\\Exception\\ExceptionInterface If reading\n     *     contents from storage is impossible\n     */\n\n    public function read()\n    {\n        /**\n         * @todo implementation\n         */\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Writes $contents to storage.\n     *\n     * @param  mixed $contents\n     * @return void\n     * @throws \\Zend\\Authentication\\Exception\\ExceptionInterface If writing\n     *     $contents to storage is impossible\n     */\n\n    public function write($contents)\n    {\n        /**\n         * @todo implementation\n         */\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Clears contents from storage.\n     *\n     * @return void\n     * @throws \\Zend\\Authentication\\Exception\\ExceptionInterface If clearing\n     *     contents from storage is impossible.\n     */\n\n    public function clear()\n    {\n        /**\n         * @todo implementation\n         */\n    }\n}  In order to use this custom storage class,  Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService::setStorage() \nis invoked before an authentication query is attempted:  use My\\Storage;\nuse Zend\\Authentication\\AuthenticationService;\n\n// Create the authentication service instance:\n$auth = new AuthenticationService();\n\n// Instruct the authentication service to use the custom storage class:\n$auth->setStorage(new Storage());\n\n// Create the authentication adapter:\n$adapter = /* ... */;\n\n// Authenticate, saving the result, and persisting the identity on success:\n$result = $auth->authenticate($adapter);",
